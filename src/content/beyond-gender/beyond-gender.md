<p>What makes you different from the Buddha? It's what's inside you! Men think they're “men”, women think they're “women”. That's the root of all illusions! [...]<br />
Look at things from the point where you've forgotten everything: wealth and poverty, and all the scales of human values. If you succeed, a thousand saints will be no match for you. Cease fire! Forget everything! Man, forget your masculinity! Woman, forget your femininity!</p>
<p>Kodo Sawaki</p>
