<p>Question:<br />
    Why hasn't any woman's name gone down in Zen history?<br />
Answer:<br />
    Women, as well as men, have practiced Zen, and it was quite common for an elderly woman to teach a master. However, in traditional Asia, it is customary not to pass on a woman's name to posterity, even if she has spread wisdom around her, even if she has taught a master. Today, however, all that is a thing of the past. Women and men are on an equal footing, and a woman can very well become a master.</p>
