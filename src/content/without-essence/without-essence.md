<p>In this excerpt from the Vimalakīrti Sutra, Sariputra, a disciple of the Buddha, converses with a goddess. The latter's divinity should be seen only as one condition of existence among others, notably that of being human or animal, whose illusory nature the practice of zazen reveals.</p>
<p>Śāriputra:<br />
Why don't you change out of this female body?<br />
The goddess:<br />
I have been here twelve years and have looked for the innate characteristics of the female sex and haven’t been able to find them. What is there to change? If a sorcerer were to conjure up a phantom woman and then someone asked her why she didn't change out of her female body, would that be any kind of reasonable question?<br />
Śāriputra:<br />
No. Phantoms have no fixed form, so what would there be to change?<br />
The goddess:<br />
All things are just the same — they have no fixed form. So why ask why I don't change out of my female form?</p>
<p>At that time the goddess employed her supernatural powers to change Śāriputra into a goddess like herself, while she took on Śāriputra's form.<br />
The goddess:<br />
Why don't you change out of this female body?<br />
Śāriputra:<br />
I don't know why I have suddenly changed and taken on a female body!<br />
The goddess:<br />
Śāriputra, if you can change into a female form, then all women can also change. Śāriputra, who is not a woman, appears in a woman's body. And the same is true of all women—though they appear in women's bodies, they are not women. Therefore, the Buddha teaches that all phenomena are neither male nor female.<br />
Then the goddess, by her supernatural power, changed Śāriputra back into his own form.<br />
The goddess:<br />
Where are the female form and innate characteristics now?<br />
Śāriputra:<br />
The female form and innate characteristics neither exist nor do not exist.</p>
