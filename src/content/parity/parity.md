<p>Question:<br />
 Are there any women among the masters?<br />
Answer:<br />
    Today in my sangha, there are six female masters and four male masters. Parity... [...] Many women are less attracted by power. There are more power struggles between men, and besides, we live in a man's world, there's always war and there's enough of it, so why don't they listen to a bit of feminine wisdom? Real feminine wisdom, not women who imitate men or women who adapt to a man's world, real women. That's what we're waiting for to save the planet.</p>
